 * The composer's skill picker over the design catalogs.
 *
 * Same recipes the model can fetch mid-turn via get_design_technique /
 * get_font_pairing — the difference is who decides. A skill the user picked is
 * loaded into the first request and stated as a requirement, so it never
 * depends on the model choosing to reach for the tool.
 *
 * The teasers in both catalogs are written as "id — description" for the
 * system-prompt index. Those read as instructions to a model, not as picker
 * copy, so the picker carries its own: a short scannable summary plus a
 * concrete example of the result, shown on hover.
